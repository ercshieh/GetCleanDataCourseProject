# GetCleanDataCourseProject
Course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

There is just one script, run_analysis.R, that does all the awesome work.

However, to get it to work, first you must make sure that you have the UCI HAR Dataset which can be found at:

Make sure you unzip the file and that the working directory has the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.

Besides that, it's a pretty simple script where I've included comments.
